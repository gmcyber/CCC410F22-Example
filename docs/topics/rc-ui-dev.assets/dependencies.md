# Ethhack UI Dependencies

This project is fortunate in that it has very few dependencies that cannot be resolved.



* It needs to integrate with cyber.local AD and vcenter

  > Not a problem, I'm the admin for both (at least through semester's end)

* Sprint 4 depends on access to the SEC335 instructor and SEC335 students

  > Will require some communication and an incentive for the students.  I will buy the instructor lunch as a mitigation strategy

* Server resources are modest and will take the form of an infrastructure VM

* vcenter8 and esxi might be problems that arise as we may plan an upgrade over the winter break.  It is unclear if pyvmomi will support vcenter 8.  This needs to be researched over the winter break or during the first implementation sprint.
