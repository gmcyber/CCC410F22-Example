# Abstract

Commercial Cyber Security Ranges typically features a portal that abstracts the complexities associated with the target backend infrastructure.  The labs for Ethical Hacking at Champlain College leverage the cyber.local vcenter infrastructure for access to individual VMs as well as the target network.  Some features require a good deal of navigating and clicking around.  For instance, to revert a target, one has to log into vcenter, navigate to the appropriate folder, the associated VM, open a context menu, revert the VM and then restart it.

Additionaly, the vcenter interface does not provide contextual information on the targets such as hints.  The student would need to find that in CANVAS.  Submission of flags is also a manual process and part of a pen test report.  The Range Control project will seek to simplify student access to the ethical hacking environment by providing the functionality and contextual information required in a single web page.
