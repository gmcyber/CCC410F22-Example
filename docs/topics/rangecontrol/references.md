# References

> :bulb: Github Markup style doesn't provide a lot of tools for generating citations.  We will use a Bibliography that looks like this on a single page.  Pick a standard like MLA, APA and use a tool such as Zotero to generate and manage.  Your job will be to create the anchors in this table and then reference the table using inline citations shown elsewhere.  Use a variety of sources like books, journals and websites (particularly for late breaking and highly technical information)

1. [Django 4 for the Impatient, 2ND EDITION, by Greg Lim & Daniel Correa, PACKT Publishing, 2022](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/django-4-for/9781803245836/).
    This is a very quick overview for Django, the intent is to go through this during Design Sprint 1 to confirm or deny this frameworks suitability for the project.

2. [django-auth-ldap, Jon Dufresne, et. al](https://github.com/django-auth-ldap/django-auth-ldap/graphs/contributors)

  If Django is selected, this LDAP library appears to be the best maintained
